      <p class="home-text">   "Several features have been proposed as markers of gay male identity (or more accurately, white middle class American gay male identity, since this is the group that has been the topic of most research).</p>

    <p class="home-text">These features include overly careful pronunciation, a wide pitch range, high and rapidly changing pitch, breathy tone, lengthened fricative sounds (for example, long s, z) and pronunciation of t and d as ts and dz. Also, ritual insults, irony, sarcasm, use of sexual and erotic reference, and women-related imagery and metaphor have all been cited. Finally, slang and other new words, mostly relating to aspects of gay and lesbian culture, have been widely noted. Strong evidence for almost all of these features, however, has been elusive."</p> <h5>"Gayspeak" by glbtq</h5>
      
      <p>Is there such thing as a gay accent?</p>

<p class="home-text">Rudolf Gaudio investigated the claim that people can differentiate between gay and straight men based solely upon their speech, and listeners base their judgments on the use of a wider pitch range and greater fluctuating pitch. Although he found that listeners could distinguish gay from straight men, he failed to find any convincing empirical differences in pitch between these two groups. In short, part (b) of his hypothesis was not upheld. This study is representative of others that have failed to find concrete differences in the speech of gay and straight men.

Arnold Zwicky hypothesizes that the lack of a consistent and significant difference between gay male and straight male speech may stem from gay identity being marked by variation from stereotypically male (linguistic) behavior, with the form of differentiation being potentially various, and less important than the fact of differentiation itself.</p>
